# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.
First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.
Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?
Your answer: A conditional statement contains either a single or multiple conditions that the program evaluates to be either true or false, and it will execute the code block following the conditional that evaluates to be true.
Researched answer: Conditional statements check for any number of specific conditions and perform tasks based on which of those conditions evaluates to true. JavaScript utilizes conditionals to control behavior and determine whether or not certain lines of code will be allowed to run.

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?
Your answer: GitHub is a cloud service and program that allows developers and programmers alike to collaborate on projects and upload their works. GitHub is the general cloud service itself that contains all data uploaded by users, while git is only the data that is pulled from GitHub and contains the data that exists on your own device.
Researched answer: Git allows users to keep track of and manage source code history that have been conducted on a user's personal device. GitHub is the cloud based hosting service that lets users upload their works, manage repositories, and collaborate with other users.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?
Your answer: Logical operators (and && / or || / not !) return boolean values.
Researched answer: (Same as my answer as far as my research shows!)

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?
Your answer: An index is a numbered position assigned to either elements in an array or characters in a string. The difference between an index and value is that, rather than being a numbered position, a value is the element itself. For example, let's say we have an array that looks like this. ['Indigo', 'Violet', 'Orange']. Indigo itself is the value but it's index is 0 (also remember that arrays/strings are zero indexed meaning that the first position is numbered 0 rather than 1).
Researched answer: An index contains the numbered position of either elements in an array or characters in a string, while values are the actual content of those elements in an array or the characters in a string.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.
Your answer: Arrays are collections of data that can hold various datatypes such as numbers, strings, etc. Strings are simply, strings of characters put together and surrounded in quotes (either single or double quotes, but use double quotes if the string contains a single quote within it, like don't or they're). Arrays and strings are both zero indexed, meaning that the first element of an array or the first character of a string is at the 0 position, and from there it counts normally. Arrays and strings are different however because strings are simply a data type, but arrays are assigned to variables that can contain strings within them, along with other datatypes.
Researched answer: Strings are used for storing and manipulating text while arrays are special variables that can hold more than one value. Indexes of elements in an array and characters in a string are the same (as described above).

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?
Your answer: In pair programming you have two people working on code at the same time, but they are assigned to be either the driver or navigator. The driver is the person responsible for actually writing out the code while the navigator is the person telling the driver specifically what to put down. In essence, the driver puts down what the navigator tells them to.
Researched answer: In order to enforce proper pair programming techniques, the pair of people working on a project will want to define a number of things before jumping into the project. The duration of the session, goals set for that session, tasks that should be accomplished, and how often the roles of driver/navigator should be switched should all be discussed. In terms of roles, the driver writes the code and the navigator reviews the code, makes sure that the driver is inputting data correctly without syntax errors or typos, and they also plan the course of action.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.
1. Higher Order Functions: When functions are utilized within other functions. For example, a function could accept another function as a parameter if it has been assigned to a variable, or the higher function could return another function.
2. Jest: A type of JavaScript testing framework.
3. Objects: Containers for named values called properties. Objects can also have methods.
4. Method: Actions that can be performed on objects. Methods are properties containing a function definition.
5. Classes: Templates for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data.
